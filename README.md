## My process

First, analyzing how the html markup will I make from the design image. Then start to make the markup with mobile first workflow. After that, I make a new SCSS file and compile it to be a pure css to make the style readable by browser. Then uploaded it on Github and publish it with Github Page.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap 5
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS variable
- Media query
- CSS blending mode
